# Physician-Drug-Adoption-Prediction
One of the top 5 pharmaceutical companies, Axtratia, headquartered in the US, had launched Axtenna, a drug for the treatment of stage 1 chronic kidney disease, 2.5 years ago. However, some physicians are yet to prescribe it for the first time. A key client stakeholder has reached out to a Decision Sciences Principal in Axtria for help to identify potential physicians who are most likely to start prescribing the drug in the next quarter in order to channelize the marketing efforts more effectively while targeting potential physicians.

We need to create a model that identifies the prospective physicians who have high likelihood to start prescribing the drug in 11th quarter for the first time.
